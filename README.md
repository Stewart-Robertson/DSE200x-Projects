# DSE200x-Projects
Two projects done when first learning python for data science via UC San Diego on EdX

Project 1
This one - CO2, Urbanisation, and GDP - was a simple "mini-project" undertaken in 2020. The aim was to use a publicly available dataset, structure some questions
and convey conclusions via a PowerPoint presentation. Analysis was done using python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The definition for the project was broad and any dataset
could be used.

I've uploaded both files in PDF format because the powerpoint presentation is attached at the end of the jupyter notebooks.

Project 2
This was a larger project and I wanted to use it as an opportunity to get some practice implementing simple machine learning algorithms for the first time.
It was similar to the first project in that the scope was fairly broad, as long as it was an original project with analysis done with python and asociated packages,
and conclusions conveyed via PowerPoint presentation.
